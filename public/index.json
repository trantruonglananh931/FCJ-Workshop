As data becomes increasingly sensitive and valuable, database security requirements have grown more stringent — not only from a technical perspective but also to meet compliance standards such as GDPR, SOX, and HIPAA.\nDatabase Security Hardening with Encryption and Access Controls aims to deliver a comprehensive security solution for database systems on the AWS Cloud platform by:\nEncrypting data at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access. Implementing access controls based on the principles of detailed role-based permissions and the principle of least privilege Enabling audit logging to monitor activities and support security investigations. Managing encryption keys (KMS) and performing regular risk assessments. Reporting and ensuring compliance with security standards as required by business or legal regulations. "
