In the digital era, databases serve as the central backbone of most information systems. As data becomes increasingly sensitive and valuable, database security requirements have grown more stringent â€” not only from a technical perspective but also to meet compliance standards such as **GDPR**, **SOX**, and **HIPAA**.

**Database Security Hardening with Encryption and Access Controls** aims to deliver a comprehensive security solution for database systems on the AWS Cloud platform by:

- Encrypting data at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access.
- Implementing access controls based on the principles of detailed role-based permissions and the principle of least privilege
- Enabling audit logging to monitor activities and support security investigations.
- Managing encryption keys (KMS) and performing regular risk assessments.
- Reporting and ensuring compliance with security standards as required by business or legal regulations.
